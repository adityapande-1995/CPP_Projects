# Quadtree visualization

## Introduction
This is a simple program to visualize quadtrees. It can be run in an intractive or a non interactive mode.

## How to build and run

Clone the repo first, and then : 
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..; make
./quadtree_viz
```

or you can run it in an interactive mode :

```sh
./quadtree_viz --interactive
```

Here you can click around and those points will be added to the quadtree.
