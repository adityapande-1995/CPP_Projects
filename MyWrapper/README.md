# An wrapper over OpenGL API

## Introduction
This is an attempt to write my own wrapper/boilerplate over OpenGL to make it usable. 

## How to use
File "m.cpp" contains the code. "main.cpp" contains an example. To compile and run, execute
```
make all && make run
```

## To do:
- [x] Mouse zoom
- [ ] View Axes
- [ ] Mouse pan 
- [ ] Grid view
- [ ] Camera info on screen
- [ ] Lighting and material
