# An wrapper over OpenGL API

## Introduction
This is an attempt to write my own wrapper/boilerplate over OpenGL to make it usable. 

## How to use
File "m.cpp" contains the code. "main.cpp" contains an example. To compile and run, execute
```
make all && make run
```

## Navigation
Camera controls:
* Right, Left arrow : Move in +x and -x direction respectively.
* Up, Down arrow: Move in +y and -y direction respectively.
* "n", "m" : Move in +z and -z direction respectively.
* Space bar : Restore original camera position.


## To do:
- [x] Mouse zoom
- [ ] View Axes
- [ ] Mouse pan 
- [ ] Grid view
- [ ] Camera info on screen
- [ ] Lighting and material
